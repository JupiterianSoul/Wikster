 * The social release (chat, trades, gifts, presence, avatars) added columns
 * to `profiles` and three new tables. A project running the older schema is
 * a normal state - the owner has not re-run schema.sql yet - and it must NOT
 * take the friends list down with it.
 *
 * So the shape of the database is DETECTED rather than assumed: the first
 * query asks for the new columns, and if the server says they are not there,
 * it is remembered and every later query asks only for what exists. Friends,
 * search and requests keep working; the newer features report themselves as
 * unavailable instead of failing at random.
