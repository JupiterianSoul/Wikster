/**
 * THE DAILY QUESTS, from the player's side.
 * ============================================================================
 * Three quests a day, dealt by the quests function from the UTC date and
 * the player's id (src/data/quests.js is the book). The rest of the app
 * reports what the player does through track(); this credits the day's
 * quests, keeps them on the device, and tells the server in batches. A
 * reward is claimed through the server, which pays out only when its own
 * copy of the progress meets the target.
 *
 * Signed out, the same deal is made on the device from the date alone, and
 * progress and claims stay on the device: a player without an account still
 * has quests, but nothing about them reaches a leaderboard.
 *
 * THE LEDGER. Everything reported today is also written down as it is, an
 * event at a time, next to the dealt rows. A deal can change under the
 * player: the app tracks a minute of play before the session is back, then
 * signs in and the account's own three replace the device's; or the server
 * answers with rows the device had not seen. Whenever a new deal appears,
 * its progress is replayed from the ledger, so nothing done today is ever
 * lost to a change of deal. The ledger is the day's truth; the rows are a
 * view of it.
