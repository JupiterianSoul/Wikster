 * SAVE TRANSFER
 * ============================================================================
 * Everything the player has lives in this device's localStorage, which is tied
 * to the app install. Reinstalling - or moving to another phone - loses it.
 *
 * This turns the whole save into one block of text that can be copied out and
 * pasted back. It is the only bridge across an uninstall, and the only way to
 * move a collection between devices.
 *
 * The format is deliberately dull: a JSON envelope with a version, a
 * timestamp and the raw stored strings. No compression, no encoding tricks -
 * a save you cannot inspect is a save you cannot rescue by hand when
 * something goes wrong with it.
