 * churning boosters.** Selling a booster's entire contents returns a fixed
 * fraction of what the booster cost, whatever tier it was, so the
 * sell-buy-bigger-sell loop always leaks value instead of compounding. A lucky
 * Prismatic can still pay for several packs - that's the thrill - but it is
 * variance around a losing mean, not a strategy.
 *
 * Concretely:
 *   sell value of a card   = SELL_RATE × its price
 *   price of a booster     = its expected sell value ÷ RETURN_RATE
 *
 * so E[sell everything] = RETURN_RATE × price, for every booster in the game.
 * Progression therefore comes from time (the shop stipend), not from grinding.
