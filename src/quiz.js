/**
 * THE QUIZ
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Pick a subject, meet one card you probably do not own, answer three to five
 * questions about its article, and walk away with money, the card itself, or
 * a booster, depending on how many you got right. The questions are written
 * on the spot by a language model from the article's own text, and they get
 * harder the rarer the card is.
 *
 * The key that pays for that is NOT in this app. A key shipped inside an APK
 * is a key anyone can pull back out of it, so the request goes to a small
 * Supabase Edge Function (supabase/functions/quiz) which holds the key as a
 * server-side secret. Players need no key, no setting and no account for it:
 * the app already carries the publishable Supabase key, and that is all the
 * function asks for.
