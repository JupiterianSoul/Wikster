-- WIKSTER - database schema
-- ============================================================================
-- Run this once, whole, in your Supabase project's SQL editor
-- (Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> New query -> paste -> Run).
--
-- Three tables:
--   profiles      one public row per player: username and the stats a friend
--                 is allowed to see. Readable by any signed-in player, because
--                 that is what username search needs.
--   saves         the private save blob. Readable ONLY by its owner. A friend
--                 sees the cards through friend_cards() below, which hands back
--                 that one key and nothing else in the blob.
--   friendships   one row per request, from requester to addressee.
--
-- Every table has row-level security on. The anon key shipped in the app is
-- public by design; these policies, not the key, are what keep one player out
-- of another's data. Nothing below trusts the client.
-- ============================================================================

-- --- profiles ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Usernames are plain text with a unique index on lower(username), rather than
-- the citext extension. Same effect - one person may hold "Ada" and nobody
-- else may hold "ada" - with nothing to install, so this script cannot fail on
-- an extension the project will not grant.

-- asking once a minute. It now listens: the social tables join the Realtime
-- publication, and the rows a player may read (their row-level rules apply

-- written. Friendships keep their whole row on delete so a removal still
-- names who it was about. The board's three windows are published too, so a
-- leaderboard on screen moves as scores land.
--
-- submit_score gains the quiz and the slot machine, and no longer inflates a
-- window when a day's best is beaten: the row is updated in place and the
-- windows take the difference, instead of a delete that subtracted nothing
-- followed by an insert that added everything again.
